<h3>Maddie Rajavasireddy</h3>

<b>Description:  
Created a new Express application using express-generator

Built an array of instances of a Project class. This is contained within its own module, such that it can be required in a route

There is an index page with each project listed along with some of its information

If one clicks on a Project, it should takes you to a page for just that project. This page   contains  some additional information (bigger image, github link, page link) not available on the index page

Can be run using command `npm start` and opened in browser at http://localhost:3001
